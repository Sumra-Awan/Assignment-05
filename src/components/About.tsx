      Hello! I’m a passionate web developer and tech enthusiast, currently pursuing my studies at GIAIC, where I’m diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence, Web 3.0, and the Metaverse. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I love bringing ideas to life through modern frameworks like React and Next.js, creating dynamic and user-friendly applications.

I’m also skilled in Tailwind CSS, ensuring that my designs are not only efficient but visually appealing. My dedication to learning keeps me up-to-date with the latest trends and innovations in technology, allowing me to continuously enhance my skills and take on new challenges.

Technology isn’t just a field of study for me—it’s a passion. I’m always exploring, experimenting, and evolving to stay ahead of the curve and make a meaningful impact through my work.
